When you have a setup where your client is running on `https://localhost:3000` and your server is running on `http://localhost:5500`, you need to handle a couple of key points to make the WebAuthn registration and verification process work correctly. This includes challenges during the user registration and ensuring proper communication between the client and server. Here’s how to do that step by step:

### 1. Serving the Backend over HTTPS

First and foremost, WebAuthn is designed to work over secure contexts (HTTPS). Since your server is currently running on `http`, you will need to set it up to run over `https`. You can achieve this by creating a self-signed certificate for development purposes. Here’s how to do it.

#### Creating a Self-Signed Certificate

If you haven’t created a certificate yet, you can do it using OpenSSL:

```bash
# Generate a self-signed SSL certificate (adjust the parameters if needed)
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 36525 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout server.key -out server.cert
```

Make sure to fill out the required fields. For the Common Name (CN), you can use `localhost`.

#### Update Your Node.js Server

Once you have your SSL certificate, update your Node.js server to use HTTPS. Here’s an example:

```typescript
import https from 'https';
import fs from 'fs';
import express from 'express';

// Load SSL certificate
const sslOptions = {
  key: fs.readFileSync('path/to/server.key'), // Adjust the path
  cert: fs.readFileSync('path/to/server.cert'), // Adjust the path
};

const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

// Your routes (like registration and verification) go here

const PORT = 5500;
https.createServer(sslOptions, app).listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on https://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```
